:mod:`hub.motion <hub.motion>` -- Motion
==============================================================

.. module:: hub.motion

The motion module lets you access the 6-degree of freedom MEMS sensor in
the hub. You can measure the hub acceleration, angular velocity, and
orientation. You can also detect certain motion events such as free fall.

The default orientation of the hub is horizontal, with the lights and buttons
on top and the USB charging port facing forward. For example, this is how the
hub is mounted in a vehicle robot such as TRICKY.

To understand the directions of motion, it can be helpful to imagine that you
are sitting in the hub, as the driver of the vehicle:

- Yaw: Positive values up to 179 degrees mean that the car has steered to the
  right. Negative values down to -180 mean you have steered to the left.
- Pitch: Positive means you are driving up a hill, so that the front of the car
  points upward, up to 90 degrees. Negative means you are driving downhill,
  down to -90 degrees.
- Roll: Positive values up to 179 degrees means your car is leaning to the
  right, as if driving only on its right wheels. Negative values down to -180
  mean your car is leaning to the left, as if driving on its left wheels.

Using the same analogy as a driver in your car, the following applies about
axes and acceleration values:

- The positive X axis points to the right of your car: A positive acceleration
  along the X axis means you are accelerating to the right. Negative means to
  the left.
- The positive Y axis points to the front of your car: A positive acceleration
  along the Y axis means you are accelerating forward, as if pressing the gas.
  Negative means backward, as if hitting the brakes or reversing.
- The positive Z axis points up. A positive acceleration along the Z axis means
  that you are accelerating upward. Negative means downward.

Likewise, the following applies for angular velocity:

- A positive angular rate velocity the X axis means you are tilting upward.
- A positive angular rate velocity the Y axis mean you are rolling to the
  right.
- A positive angular rate velocity the Z axis mean you are steering to the
  left.

You can specify how the hub is aligned in your model using
the :func:`hub.motion.align_to_model` function.
This way, the values will be adjusted such that the analogies above still apply
even if your hub isn't mounted horizontally in your model.
