This is the MicroPython documentation for the LEGO MINDSTORMS Inventor Hub and
the LEGO Education SPIKE Prime Hub. MicroPython is a small and efficient
Python implementation that can run on the micro controllers inside these hubs.

LEGO has extended MicroPython with the ``hub`` package, which provides access
to LEGO motors, sensors, and devices built into the hub.
This page provides the documentation for the ``hub`` module. Use the menu
on the left to view all available modules in this package.

Several standard MicroPython modules are also available. You can find
documentation for those modules in the official `MicroPython`_ documentation.
